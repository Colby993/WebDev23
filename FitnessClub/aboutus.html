				<h1>Common Exercises</h1>
					<p>The following are common exercises that we encourage our clients to 
					do as part of their daily exercise routine.</p>
					<dl>
					<dt>Burpee</dt>
					<dd>Burpees are a great full-body exercise to increase your strength and endurance. 
					Begin in a standing position, drop into a squat and extend your hands forward, 
					kick your feet back and then forward again quickly, and then jump up from a squatted position. </dd>
				
					<dt>Plank</dt>
					<dd>Planks build your core strength. To perform a plank, get in a push-up position and rest your 
						forearms on the floor. Hold the position as long as you can. </dd>
					
					<dt>Mountain Climber</dt>
					<dd>Mountain climbers are a good cardio exercise. 
						Place your hands on the floor in a push-up position, bring one knee up to your chest, 
						and then switch as quickly as you can (as though you are climbing a mountain).</dd>
